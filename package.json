To prevent that, we create a browser session. The goal is that users can log out from other currently active browsers so that browsers on devices that are not in use can be cleaned or logged out again. User can find it in their profile page.     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89993118/175805352-48541409-9ad2-4339-bd78-5c7b5acfcda5.png) ## Prevents IDOR",
